# Energy Oracle Solochain

## 📌 About the Project

This is a standalone blockchain built with Substrate (Solochain).

The project implements a custom pallet called **Oracle**, responsible for recording energy deltas on-chain by network and timestamp.

The goal is to explore runtime logic development with FRAME, structured storage, and on-chain event emission.

## 🧩 Pallet Oracle

Location:
pallets/oracle/src/lib.rs

### 🎯 Objective

Record energy variations (`delta_input`, `delta_output`) associated with:

- `network_id`
- `oracle_timestamp`

Each record is unique by the combination of `network_id + timestamp`.

---

## 🗄 Storage

The pallet uses a `StorageDoubleMap`:

EnergyLedger:

Key 1:
- `network_id: u32`

Key 2:
- `oracle_timestamp: u64`

Value:
- `(delta_input: u32, delta_output: u32)`

Hashing:
- Blake2_128Concat

This model allows multiple independent networks, each with its temporal history.

## 🚀 Dispatchables

### submit_delta

Parameters:

- `network_id: u32`
- `delta_input: u32`
- `delta_output: u32`
- `oracle_timestamp: u64`

Function:

- Checks if the timestamp already exists for the network
- Inserts the delta into the ledger
- Emits event `DeltaStored`

Overwrite protection:

If a record already exists for the same `network_id` and `timestamp`, the transaction fails with:

TimestampAlreadyExists

---

## 📢 Events

DeltaStored(
    network_id,
    oracle_timestamp,
    delta_input,
    delta_output
)

Emitted whenever a new delta is successfully stored.

---

## ❌ Errors

TimestampAlreadyExists

Prevents overwriting historical data that has already been recorded.

---

## 🧪 Current Status

- Node compiles and runs
- Pallet integrated into the runtime
- StorageDoubleMap functional
- Overwrite protection implemented
- Events working correctly
- Tested via Polkadot.js

---

## 🚀 Running Locally
